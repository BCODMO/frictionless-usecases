For metadata for this dataset see: https://www.bco-dmo.org/dataset/699169

# Original data

The [orig](orig) folder contains 20 of the 68 originally submitted .csv files. Each file contains data for one CTD cast.

The files contain seabird comment/header information at the top of the file.

# Data processing needs:

* concatenation of each data file into one resource
* extraction of cast information from the filename (e.g."CTD DOLDIET017_FEB2017_CAST005.csv")
